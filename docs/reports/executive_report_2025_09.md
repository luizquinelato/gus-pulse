- **Simplified Timeline**: Reduced from 2 weeks to 1 week based on technical review

**Implementation Scope**:
- **Database Schema**: Add `raw_extraction_data` table to migration 0001 for storing complete API responses
- **Unified Models**: Copy `unified_models.py` from etl-service to backend for data consistency
- **Directory Structure**: Create `queue/`, `transformers/`, `loaders/` directories in backend
- **RabbitMQ Integration**: Implement `queue_manager.py` with RabbitMQ connectivity and message publishing
- **Raw Data APIs**: Create endpoints for storing, retrieving, and updating raw extraction data
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation of batch processing, queue messages, and API functionality

**Business Impact**: Establishes foundation for 60-80% reduction in ETL processing time, 10x faster job recovery, and 90% reduction in manual intervention. The hybrid architecture maintains all existing job orchestration while enabling modern queue-based processing for improved performance and reliability. Complete documentation ensures smooth Phase 1 implementation with clear technical guidance and architectural decisions.
