## 📊 Table Grouping Strategy

### Improved Business-Aligned Grouping

#### 🏢 **CORE_BUSINESS** (Organizational Foundation)
```
tenants         - Tenant organizations and settings
users           - Team members and their information
```
**Rationale**: Pure organizational data - "who we serve" and "who does the work"

#### 💻 **DEVELOPMENT** (Complete Development Lifecycle)
```
projects                - Project definitions and metadata
work_items             - Jira tickets, stories, bugs, tasks
wit_changelogs         - History of work item status changes
wits                   - Work item types (Story, Bug, Epic, etc.)
wit_mappings           - Work item type mappings between systems
wit_hierarchies        - Parent-child relationships
repositories           - Git repositories and metadata
pull_requests         - GitHub/GitLab pull requests
pull_request_comments - Comments on pull requests
pull_request_reviews  - Code review data
pull_request_commits  - Commits within pull requests
```
**Rationale**: All development work and artifacts in one cohesive group

#### ⚙️ **WORKFLOW** (Process Definitions)
```
workflows        - Workflow steps and process definitions
statuses        - Available issue statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done)
status_mappings - Status mappings between systems
```
**Rationale**: Pure process definitions, separate from work items

#### 📈 **BENCHMARKS** (Industry Standards)
```
dora_market_benchmarks - Industry standard DORA metrics
dora_metric_insights   - DORA metric analysis and insights
```
**Rationale**: External benchmarking and performance standards

#### 🔗 **RELATIONSHIPS** (Data Connections)
```
wits_prs_links - Links between work items and GitHub PRs
```
**Rationale**: Cross-system data relationships and integrations
**Note**: Junction tables are managed through structured queries for optimal performance

#### 👥 **ORGANIZATIONAL** (Access & Configuration)
```
user_permissions - User access permissions
user_sessions   - User login sessions
system_settings - System configuration settings
```
**Rationale**: System administration and access control

### Smart Table Selection Logic

The AI agent intelligently selects relevant table groups based on query analysis:

```python
# Query Pattern Examples
"What teams do we have?"
→ DEVELOPMENT + WORKFLOW + RELATIONSHIPS
→ Gets: projects, work_items, workflows, and their connections

"How are our DORA metrics?"
→ BENCHMARKS + DEVELOPMENT + WORKFLOW + RELATIONSHIPS  
→ Gets: benchmarks, development data, processes, and links

"Show me workflow efficiency"
→ WORKFLOW + RELATIONSHIPS
→ Gets: process definitions and their connections
```

    {
        "execute_step": "execute_query_step",  # Loop for next step
        "analyze": "strategic_analysis"        # Proceed to analysis
    }
)
```

#### State Management

The workflow maintains comprehensive state across all steps:

```python
class StrategicAgentState(TypedDict):
    # Query planning
    query_plan: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    current_step_index: int
    
    # Data results
    all_query_results: List[Dict]
    sql_queries_executed: List[str]
    
    # Analysis results
    strategic_insights: Dict[str, Any]
    raw_ai_response: Optional[str]
    
    # Conversation context
    conversation_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    previous_analysis_results: Dict[str, Any]
```

```python
# Conversation memory structure
self.conversation_memory = {
    "conversation_id": {
        "history": [
            {
                "query": "What teams do we have?",
                "response": "Analysis of 7 teams...",
                "timestamp": 1234567890,
                "analysis_results": {...},
                "data_sources": [...]
            }
        ],
        "results": {
            "last_analysis": {...},
            "last_data_sources": [...],
            "last_query_results": [...]
        }
    }
}
```

#### Context Reuse Strategy
- **Smart Reuse**: Determines when previous results can answer new questions
- **Context Enhancement**: Builds on previous analysis for deeper insights
- **Progressive Analysis**: Each query adds to the knowledge base

#### Example Context Reuse
```python
# First query
"What teams do we have?" → Full team analysis

# Follow-up query (reuses previous data)
"Which team should we focus on?" → Uses cached team data for recommendations

# Enhanced query (builds on previous)
"How do they compare to industry benchmarks?" → Adds benchmark data to team analysis
```

### Context Building Pipeline
