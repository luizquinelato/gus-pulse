# Jira Epic Flow with Quality Assessment

**Standardized workflow for AI agents when explicitly instructed to follow jira-epic-flow**

## 🎯 When to Use This Rule

This rule should be followed **ONLY** when the user explicitly mentions "jira-epic-flow" or directly requests epic creation. 

**Epic Creation Authority**: The user will explicitly ask when they need a new epic to be created. AI agents should NOT autonomously suggest or create epics.

**Two Clear Paths:**
1. **WITH jira-epic-flow**: Follow this complete epic creation and assessment workflow
2. **WITHOUT jira-epic-flow**: Follow standard guidelines without epic creation

## 🔄 Complete Epic Creation Workflow

When instructed to follow jira-epic-flow, AI agents must execute this exact sequence:

### **FIRST: Create Comprehensive Task List**
**BEFORE starting any phases**, create complete task list including ALL steps from Phase 0 through Phase 3:
- **Phase 0 tasks**: Environment validation, coaching document review, content preparation
- **Phase 1 tasks**: Task list validation (already complete at this point)
- **Phase 2 tasks**: Epic creation, epic validation, epic transition
- **Phase 3 tasks**: RAG assessment, Product Innovation validation, usage guidance, inform user of tickets

### **Phase 0: Quality Assurance & Pre-Flight Validation**
**CRITICAL**: Validate everything BEFORE creating any Jira epics

1. **Environment Check**: Confirm all required environment variables are loaded
   - JIRA_URL, JIRA_USERNAME, JIRA_TOKEN
   - JIRA_PROJECT_KEY_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT
   - JIRA_TEAM_FIELD_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT, JIRA_TEAM_UUID_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT
   - JIRA_AGILE_TEAM_FIELD_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT, JIRA_AGILE_TEAM_VALUE_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT
   - JIRA_TSHIRT_SIZE_FIELD_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT (dynamically calculated)
   - JIRA_TEAM_SIZE_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT, JIRA_TEAM_PRODUCTIVE_HOURS_PER_WEEK_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT
   - JIRA_SPRINT_WEEKS_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT, JIRA_TEAM_STORY_POINTS_PER_SPRINT_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT
   - Epic workflow configurations

2. **Epic Quality Review**: Read and apply epic health coaching guidelines
   - Review `/docs/ai_agent_assets/jira_guidelines/wex_epic_health_coach.md`
   - Review `/docs/ai_agent_assets/jira_guidelines/wex_epic_rating_coach.md`
   - Review `/docs/ai_agent_assets/jira_guidelines/wex_work_decomposition.md`
   - Ensure epic qualifies as Product Innovation
   - Target 8+ quality score for story points field

3. **Content Preparation**: Prepare all epic components with proper Jira formatting
   - Epic title (clear and business-focused)
   - Comprehensive description with h2. headers and # numbered lists
   - BDD-format acceptance criteria for customfield_10222
   - Detailed risk assessment with mitigation plans for customfield_10218
   - Quality score (8+) for story points field (customfield_10024)
   - WEX T-Shirt Size dynamically calculated based on epic scope and team capacity (customfield_10412)

4. **Epic Assessment**: Conduct thorough quality evaluation
   - Apply RAG (Red-Amber-Green) rating system
   - Validate against Product Innovation criteria
   - Ensure INVEST principles compliance at epic level
   - Confirm 8+ score justification

5. **Abort on Validation Failure**: If ANY validation fails:
   - STOP immediately - do not create any Jira epics
   - Report specific validation errors to user
   - Request user to resolve issues before proceeding

### **Phase 1: Task List Validation**
6. **Validate Task List**: Ensure comprehensive task list was created before Phase 0
   - **Verify ALL phases included**: Phase 0 (validation), Phase 2 (epic creation), Phase 3 (quality documentation)
   - **Confirm task quality**: Each task represents meaningful work (~20 minutes each)
   - **Task list should already be complete** from the FIRST step before starting phases

### **Phase 2: Epic Creation**
7. **Create Epic**: Create epic with all enhanced fields and proper formatting
   ```bash
   python scripts/augment_jira_integration/jira_agent_client.py create-epic \
     --title "[Epic Title - Business-Focused]" \
     --description "[Comprehensive epic description with h2. headers and # numbered lists]" \
     --acceptance-criteria "[BDD format acceptance criteria with h3. headers]" \
     --story-points [QUALITY_SCORE_8_PLUS] \
     --risk-assessment "[Detailed risk assessment with h2./h3. headers and # numbered lists]"
   ```

   **Note**: WEX T-Shirt Size is automatically calculated based on epic scope analysis and team capacity configuration

8. **Epic Validation**: Verify epic was created successfully
   ```bash
   python scripts/augment_jira_integration/jira_agent_client.py get --issue [EPIC_KEY]
   ```

### **Phase 3: Quality Documentation**
9. **Provide Epic Assessment**: Document the epic quality evaluation
   - RAG rating with detailed justification
   - Product Innovation compliance confirmation
   - Quality score explanation (why 8+)
   - Recommendations for future improvements

10. **Epic Usage Guidance**: Provide guidance for using the epic
   - How to create stories under this epic
   - Reference to jira-story-flow for story creation
   - Integration with existing workflows

11. **Inform User of Created Jira Tickets**: Provide summary of all created Jira items
    - **Epic**: [EPIC_KEY] - [Epic Title]
    - **URLs**: Provide clickable links to all created items

## 🚨 Critical Requirements

### **Epic Quality Standards**
- All epics must qualify as Product Innovation per coaching guidelines
- Epic must achieve 8+ quality score (reflected in story points field)
- Must include comprehensive acceptance criteria in BDD format
- Must include detailed risk assessment with mitigation plans
- Use proper Jira markup formatting (h2., h3., #, *)

### **Content Requirements**
- **Description**: Business Objective, User Impact, Success Criteria, Scope and Boundaries, Dependencies, Assumptions
- **Acceptance Criteria (customfield_10222)**: 6+ comprehensive BDD-style criteria with h3. headers
- **Risk Assessment (customfield_10218)**: 5+ detailed risks with mitigation plans using proper formatting
- **Story Points (customfield_10024)**: Quality score of 8+ reflecting epic excellence
- **WEX T-Shirt Size (customfield_10412)**: Dynamically calculated based on epic scope and team capacity

### **WEX T-Shirt Size Dynamic Calculation**
T-shirt size is automatically calculated using intelligent scope analysis and realistic team capacity:

**Team Configuration (Configurable):**
- **Team Size**: 5 developers (JIRA_TEAM_SIZE_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT)
- **Productive Hours**: 30 hours/week per person (JIRA_TEAM_PRODUCTIVE_HOURS_PER_WEEK_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT)
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (JIRA_SPRINT_WEEKS_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT)
- **Total Capacity**: 300 hours/sprint (5 × 30 × 2)
- **Story Point Velocity**: 50 points/sprint (JIRA_TEAM_STORY_POINTS_PER_SPRINT_FOR_AUGMENT_AGENT)

**Calculation Method:**
1. **Scope Analysis**: Analyzes epic description, acceptance criteria, and risks for technical complexity
2. **Dual Estimation**: Calculates both story points and hours estimates
3. **Conservative Planning**: Uses higher estimate for better planning accuracy
4. **Automatic Mapping**: Maps sprints needed to appropriate T-shirt size

**T-Shirt Size Mapping:**
- **XXS**: <0.5 sprints - Very small enhancements
- **XS**: 0.5-1 sprint - Small feature additions
- **SM**: 1-2 sprints - Medium features
- **MD**: 2-4 sprints - Standard epic size
- **LG**: 4-8 sprints - Large initiatives
- **XL**: 8-10 sprints - Major transformations
- **XXL**: 10-12 sprints - Very large programs
- **Jumbo**: 12+ sprints - Enterprise-wide initiatives

**Scope Indicators**: Database, API, frontend, integration, authentication, performance, testing, automation, deployment, infrastructure, monitoring, analytics, AI/ML, architecture, and more.

### **Product Innovation Criteria**
- **Customer and Business Value**: Clear value proposition for both
- **New or Enhanced**: Represents new product/service or significant enhancement
- **Delivery Inclusive**: Considers how product/service is delivered
- **Epic Level**: Appropriate scope for epic-level initiative

### **Assessment Framework**
- Apply RAG (Red-Amber-Green) rating system
- Use 0-10 quality scoring scale from rating coach
- Validate against epic health coach criteria
- Ensure compliance with work decomposition principles
